      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Diego Sousa. Iâ€™m a Software developerÂ  with a creative attitude to problem solving. Â I decided to pursue software development for the opportunity to work remotely or be a freelancer . I choose this skill because it is the most sort-out nowadays. In my last position as Fire Alarm Technician . I was responsible for the inspection and maintenance of fire alarm system making sure they were up to date. Some of the software given to us had a lot of bugs or were not up to date, so I thought I could learn it and help other techs with my codingÂ  skills.Â Â Iâ€™m sure I can use my expertise to achieve great results with this initiative .",
